# Goal:
- Establish trunk links between all switches (SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4) in preparation for implementing VTP.

# Steps:

- Remote Access: Use SSH to access switches remotely, starting with the furthest (SW4) and working backwards to avoid connectivity disruptions.

- Verify Connections (CDP): On each switch, use show cdp neighbor to verify physical connections and identify connected interfaces.

## Configure Trunks:

    SW4:
    interface fa 0/8
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    
    SW3:
    interface range fa 0/7 - 8 (or interface range fa 0/7 , fa 0/8)
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    
    SW2:
    interface range gig 0/1 , fa 0/7
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    
    SW1:
    interface gig 0/1
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    
## Key Points:
- CDP: Cisco Discovery Protocol helps verify physical connections between Cisco devices.
- Interface Range: Use interface range command to configure multiple consecutive interfaces simultaneously.
- Trunk Encapsulation: Use .1q for trunking, allowing multiple VLANs to share the same physical link.
- Trunk Mode: Set the interface mode to trunk to enable trunking.
- Console Connection: Have a console cable and terminal emulator ready as a backup in case remote connectivity is lost.

## Note:
- These configurations ensure all links between the switches are configured as trunks using 802.1Q encapsulation, allowing for VLAN information to be propagated once VTP is configured.
