## ARP Flood Attack Analysis

The Wireshark capture involves a **high volume of ARP requests** within the network. The packets repeatedly query the same IP addresses, indicating a possible **ARP flood attack**.

### Observations:
- The attack starts around **packet 79** and continues throughout the capture.
- The excessive **broadcast traffic** can lead to **network congestion** and **performance degradation**.
- The frequent ARP requests may suggest an attempt to **overwhelm the network**, potentially leading to **network downtime**.

### Potential Impact:
If this is part of an **ARP poisoning attack**, the attacker could:
- **Intercept sensitive traffic**
- **Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**
- **Manipulate network traffic for malicious purposes**

### Mitigation Strategies:
To prevent this attack, Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) should be enabled on network switches to validate ARP requests and prevent spoofing. Additionally, network administrators should implement static ARP entries for critical infrastructure, complemented by VLAN segmentation to isolate broadcast traffic and reduce network congestion. Deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) will further enhance security by monitoring ARP traffic and promptly alerting administrators to suspicious activities.
