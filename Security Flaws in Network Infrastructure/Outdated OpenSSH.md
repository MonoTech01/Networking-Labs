## Outdated OpenSSH
These hosts are running **OpenSSH 5.5p1**, which is vulnerable to **CVE-2016-6210**. This vulnerability allows attackers to:  
- **Exploit weak SSH authentication** and perform brute-force attacks.  
- **Gain unauthorized access** to the system if successfully exploited.  

### Mitigation Steps:
1. **Upgrade OpenSSH to the Latest Version**  
   - Updating OpenSSH prevents attackers from exploiting known security flaws.  

2. **Disable Password-Based Authentication**  
   - Enforce **key-based authentication** to significantly reduce exposure to brute-force attacks.  

3. **Implement Security Monitoring**  
   - Use an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** to monitor and alert on suspicious SSH activity.  

4. **Restrict SSH Access**  
   - Limit SSH access to authorized users and trusted IPs.  
   - Configure firewall rules to **block unauthorized SSH traffic**.  

By applying these measures, the risk of SSH-related attacks can be **effectively minimized** and system security can be **significantly enhanced**.
